# Ancestral Ties EPGP Loot Rules
We use the EPGP loot system for our progression raids. We consider this system to be fair and efficient, resulting in minimal drama.
If you're new to our raid, please read and familiarize yourself with these rules. Guest raiders should see the [Guest](#guests) section.

#### But this is so much to read! (TL;DR)
Okay fine. TL;DR: a materialized view of the loot rules yields the following loot priority consideration:
* "Normal" from Guild Raider over MinEP (highest PR)
* "Others First" from Guild Raider over MinEP (highest PR)
* "Fishing" for tier tokens and relics by [eligible Guild Raiders](#fishing) (highest random roll)
* "Normal" from Guild Raider under MinEP (highest PR)
* "Others First" from Guild Raider under MinEP (highest PR)
* Guests or Trial Raider (whisper master looter) (highest random roll)
* Transmog (highest random roll)
* Disenchanting

If this doesn't make sense, keep reading. See [Loot Distribution](#distrib) for process details.

#### What are EP and GP?
* EP are "Effort Points", awarded to players for contributing to the guild’s raids. 
* GP are "Gear Points" and are given to a player when raid loot is distributed to them. The GP cost of an item is predetermined by a formula based on its item level, slot, and bonuses such as sockets. 

Unlike in DKP, you don’t “spend” your EP or GP when you win loot. Your numeric priority for loot is the ratio of EP divided by GP. This determines who wins a piece of loot over others asking for the same item. Whoever has the highest PR in a given roll wins the item.

#### Receiving Gear Points and Loot Options
GP is assigned to a player when items are looted to them. Loot will be assigned according to the selections made by each player and their individual loot priority. The winner will be assigned GP according to its cost. The EPGP addon shows the GP value for an item on its tooltip.
 
1. Normal (100% of item GP)
2. Others First (100% of item GP, 50% for off-role trinkets and relics)
3. Fishing for Tier and Relics (see below) (0% GP, 1 Chaos Crystal to Guild Bank)
4. Transmog (0% GP, 1 Chaos Crystal to Guild Bank)
    * Crystals owed for transmog or fishing loot should be mailed in-game to **Rour**

#### Earning Effort Points 
EP is distributed for participating in formal guild progression raids. EPGP is not used in our alt/friend casual raids. The following EP awards are available:
* On-time and Ready (at or inside raid with all needed items) at start time: 100EP/raid
* During raids: 40EP/15mins in progression raids
* Boss kills: 40EP/kill for guild's first 5 kills (inclusive)
* Boss wipes: 5EP/wipe for guild's first 5 kills (inclusive)
* Material donations: See below

##### Material Donations for Bonus EP
Players may also earn up to 200EP worth of Bonus EP each week through _optional_ material contributions to the guild. Contributions should be mailed in-game to **Zaestha**, and all EP from the week's donations will be rewarded to players following the next decay (see below).

Material contributions must be in multiples of the following quantities, and will not be prorated.
* 20 EP per 60 Starlight Rose or Leylight Shards
* 20 EP per 20 Felwort, Bacon, or Chaos Crystals
* 20 EP per 5 Cut Gems of Rare or Epic quality (such as Deadly Eye of Prophecy)
* 20 EP per 100 Felslate
* 20 EP per 200 Empyrium, Leystone Ore, or Arkhana
* 20 EP per 200 Legion Meat/Fish/Herbs used in feasts and potions
 
#### Decay
The EP and GP of the entire guild is decayed by 10% at the start of each week to reduce the benefit of hoarding loot priority and the impact of accrued GP. If you receive a large amount of GP in a short period of time from gearing up, decay reduces the severity of that GP hit over time.

## <a name="distrib"></a>Loot Distribution
When loot drops, the Master Looter will make the items available to raiders via the EPGP Lootmaster addon to select their preferences. We use the following options in order of precedent:

* **"Normal"** indicates that you wish to be included in the first priority tier for an item. The player with the highest loot priority amongst those who select this option will win the item.  

* **"Others First"** indicates that you want an item, but may want others to get first shot at it. This is effectively a courtesy _"I want it if no one else needs it more than I do”_ and is sometimes used for items that may not be large upgrades or ideal stats. Any players who select "Normal" will take precedence over this option, irrespective of relative priority. Otherwise, the player with the highest loot priority amongst those who select this option will win the item.

* **"Fishing"** indicates you are eligible for loot fishing (see below) and wish to have a chance for a possible upgrade. he winner is responsible for reimbursing the guild with a Chaos Crystal (see above).
    * This option is only valid for Tier Tokens and Relics. A "Fishing" selection for any other item will be interpreted as "Pass". 

* **"Transmog"** indicates you have no intention to use this item for any purpose other than to obtain its transmog appearance. The winner is responsible for reimbursing the guild with a Chaos Crystal (see above). 

* **"Pass"** indicates you have no interest in the item. If all players Pass on an item it will be disenchanted for the guild bank.

#### Off-role Loot

Trinkets and artifact relics that are taken as **"Others First"** for an Off-__role__ purpose (such as a DPS player looting a tanking/healing trinket), will only be assigned 50% of the item's GP cost. This encourages the continuation of off-role gearing.

***Note 1***: A raider who loots a trinket or relic for a secondary spec of the same role (ie Off-spec but not Off-role) will still be charged the full GP cost. Off-role discounting only applies to trinkets and relics assigned by “Others First” priority for use in a different DPS/Healer/Tank role category. 

***Note 2***: Relics will not be eligible for off-role discounting unless they cannot be equipped in the player’s main spec artifact

#### <a name="fishing"></a>Fishing for Tier Tokens and Relics
Because tier tokens can yield a Warforged/Titanforged item and/or sockets, and artifact relics can be upgraded with randomly-determined powers using the Netherlight Crucible (NLC), these items represent opportunities for possible upgrades that are not knowable at the time of GP assignment. We give our eligible raiders an opportunity to "fish" for upgrades on these if no players have chosen to take the item for GP cost. 

###### Tier Token Fishing Eligibility:
* Player must be a guild raider to be eligible for fishing rolls
* Player must have EP over the MinEP threshold (see below)
* Player must already possess an item-level-equivalent version of the base item. For example, to fish on a token that creates a Mythic 930+ tier helm, the player must already possess a tier helm that is Mythic 930+, Heroic Titanforged 930+, etc.
###### Relic Fishing for NLC Eligibility:
* Player must be a guild raider to be eligible for fishing rolls
* Player must have EP over the MinEP threshold (see below)
* Player must already have all same-type relics socketed in their main spec artifact at or above the loot relic's item level. 
    * *Example*: A 925 Fel Relic is available for fishing. A Havoc Demon Hunter must have a 925+ Relic in both Fel sockets to be eligible. If one of their Fel relics is not 925 or greater, they are not eligible.

#### <a name="guests"></a>Guest Raiders and MinEP
New guild raiders must surpass a minimum EP (MinEP) threshold to be eligible to leverage their loot priority against players with an EP over that threshold. This provides a short-lived barrier ensure that fresh raiders cannot immediately win loot over other raiders on their first night. We use a MinEP of 750EP, which is slightly more than one night of farm content.

Guild Raiders below MinEP can still win loot for GP if no players over the MinEP have selected "Normal", "Others First", or "Fishing" on the item.

Guests to our progression raid and trial raiders who are not in the guild may also receive loot if it would otherwise go for Transmog or Disenchanting. The winner will be determined by random rolls. **If you don't have the EPGP addons, whisper the Master Looter if you're interested in any items when they drop.**
